# Online_Grocery_Store
The grocery store company is transitioning to automated processes and management, seeking to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online. To achieve this, an object-oriented software is being developed, encompassing modules such as registration for customers, managers, and admins, along with secure login functionalities. Home screens with sub-menus tailored to each user type will be displayed upon login. Admins will manage stores, users, and product catalogs, while managers oversee inventory management and online shopping. Customers can browse products, add to cart, and make payments using various gateways. Additionally, a store checkout simulation tool will allow for testing different cashier configurations to optimize efficiency. Binary file handling is emphasized, and a user-friendly interface design is made.
